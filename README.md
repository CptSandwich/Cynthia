Cynthia is a bolt action blaster using the same basic layout as the Indra by CaptainSlug. Cynthia began with me figuring out how to fix all the issues with the Indra. I pretty quickly realized it would be easier to design a whole new blaster from the ground up than to fix the Indra part by part.
Cynthia contains no original Indra parts.

## What does Cynthia fix vs the Indra?
Cynthia fixes almost all the issues the Indra had:
- Fixed catch reliability by using the plunger system from the SLAB (modified to be longer)
- Improved plunger tube attachment strength
- Improved ramrod retention
- Made Cynthia slimmer
- Lengthened the stock to be Caliburn V4 length.
- Massively improved trigger feel
- Made the blaster lighter
- Less hardware cost
- Vastly improved front half rigidity
- A lot easier to assemble, disassemble, and swap springs.
- The thumbhole stock is easily removable, and is not required (on the Indra, the stock rod is required for blaster rigidity)
- Probably more stuff that I can't remember

## Optional Parts

There are many variant parts for Cynthia:
- Front Ends
- - Cynthia text or no Cynthia text
- - Ported and unported
- - Slim front end
- Pump action conversion kit (WIP)
- Two grip styles
- Thumbhole stock or no thumbhole stock
- Fully enclosed plunger tube travel space, or open plunger tube space
- Several bolt handle options and lengths
- Several mag release options
- Locking bolt handle or freely-moving bolt handle
